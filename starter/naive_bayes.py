TODO: You will need to implement the following functions:
- train_nb: ndarray, ndarray, int -> Params
- predict_nb: Params, ndarray -> ndarray

Implementation description will be provided under each function.

For the following:
- N: Number of samples.
- D: Dimension of input features.
- C: Number of classes (labels). We assume the class starts from 0.
